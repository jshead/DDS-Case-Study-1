# Doing Data Science Case Study 1 Budweiser Beers and Breweries 

## Overview
This repository contains the analysis of beer data, focused on uncovering insights into Alcohol By Volume (ABV) and International Bitterness Units (IBU) across various beer styles. It aims to understand consumer preferences and inform strategic decisions for product development and marketing.

## Project Contents
- `t_test_analysis/`: Directory containing T-Test analysis scripts and outputs, highlighting differences in ABV and IBU between IPAs and Pale Ales.
- `data_visualizations/`: Directory with R scripts and images for visual data analysis, including distribution of ABV and IBU.
- `presentation_materials/`: Contains slides and materials prepared for the executive presentation at Budweiser.

## Key Findings
- IPAs tend to have a higher ABV and IBU than Pale Ales, indicating a preference for stronger and more bitter beers in this market segment.
- The data suggest distinct taste preferences for IPA and Pale Ale consumers, potentially guiding targeted product innovation.

## Usage
Each directory contains scripts and associated documentation. To run an analysis, navigate to the desired directory and follow the instructions in the script comments.
