# Codebook for Case Study 1 Beer Data Analysis Project

## Introduction
This codebook documents the datasets, code, and presentation materials used in the beer data analysis project. It aims to provide clarity on the variables, the data structure, and the analytical processes undertaken throughout the project.

## Datasets
### Beers.csv
- **Columns**:
  - `Name`: Name of the beer.
  - `ABV`: Alcohol by volume as a percentage.
  - `IBU`: International Bitterness Units, a measure of the beer's bitterness.

  - Additional columns describing characteristics and metrics of each beer.
- **Preprocessing Steps**:
  - Removed entries with missing ABV values.
  - Normalized text fields to capitalize the beer styles.
- **Source**: Provided by Budweiser's database.

### Breweries.csv
- **Columns**:
  - `Brewery_ID`: Unique identifier for each brewery.
  - `Name`: Name of the brewery.
  - `City`: City where the brewery is located.
  - `State`: State where the brewery is located.
- **Preprocessing Steps**:
  - Merged with Beers.csv on `Brewery_ID` to associate beers with breweries.
- **Source**: Provided by Budweiser's database.

## Code Files
### Case Study 1 Markdown.Rmd
- **Description**: R Markdown file containing the analysis scripts, comments, and narrative for the project.
- **Contents**:
  - Exploratory data analysis
  - Statistical tests (t-tests)
  - Data visualization (ggplot2)
- **Dependencies**: Requires R and the following libraries: dplyr, ggplot2, tidyr.

## Presentation Materials
- **Slide Decks**: Presentations summarizing the findings and insights from the data analysis.
- **Charts and Graphs**: Visual aids created from the analysis to support the presentation.

## Usage
